#Diagram-Core
#### What is the Diagram Core?
The Diagram core contains a collection of server-side tools, mainly focusing on the generation of a set of JSON files to be consumed by the Pathway Diagram Viewer v3.0. As illustrated in the following figure, the Diagram-core utilises the Reactome-Core to generate two different types of files for every single pathway diagram. The first file includes layout information (nodes, edges, co-ordinates, glyphs, names, shades, etc.), while the second file includes a graph of the pathway diagram and all its contained entities.

#### How do I generate all pathway diagrams ?
** Maven Setup: https://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/maven-in-five-minutes.html.
 <ol>
  <li>Clone the Diagram-Core repository on your end

```
git clone https://github.com/reactome-pwp/diagram-core.git
```
  </li>
  <li>Navigate into diagram-core</li>
  <li>Package with Maven
```
mvn clean package
```
  </li>
  <li>Diagram-core Help: --help
```
java -jar target/tools-jar-with-dependencies.jar --help
```
  </li>
  <li>Convert all pathway diagrams
  
  command help (ensure special characters are escaped):
```
java -jar target/tools-jar-with-dependencies.jar Convert
     -h dbhost 
     -d dbschema
     -u dbuser
     -p dbpass 
     -o output_folder
     -r list_of_trivial_molecules
     -v 
```
e.g

```
java -jar target/tools-jar-with-dependencies.jar Convert
     -h localhost 
     -d reactome
     -u root
     -p root 
     -o /Users/reactome/diagram/static
     -r /Users/reactome/diagram/trivialchemicals.txt
     -v 
```
  </li>
 </ol>
#### How do I generate specific pathway diagrams ?
The user can also specify a target list of diagrams to be generated by using the -t switch and the list of DBIDs like in the example:

```
java -jar target/tools-jar-with-dependencies.jar Convert
     -h localhost 
     -d reactome
     -u root
     -p root 
     -o /Users/reactome/diagram/static
     -r /Users/reactome/diagram/trivialchemicals.txt
     -t:5654738,5655291,2219530,5637815
     -v 
```
